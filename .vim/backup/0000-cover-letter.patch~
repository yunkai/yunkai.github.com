Subject: [zookeeper][PATCH v2 00/11] INTRODUCE
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

I refactor zookeeper driver with following patches.

Features:
- all operations are lock free
- support more than 1000 nodes
- optimize the size of message
- using zookeeper more efficiently 

These patches have been tested for several weeks in our
100 physical machines, we startup 10 sheep processes in each
machine to simulate 1000 nodes, it works nicely for us.

At this time, accord is not stable enough for us, this new
zookeeper driver maybe a good alternative.

Rebasing these patches is too difficult, hope it can be merged
as soon as quickly, so that we can imporve it more easily in
the future.

  If previous zookeeper session exists, shutdown sheep
